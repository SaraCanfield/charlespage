This project is a website for a playwright.  

I developed this page using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and Devise.  It uses an SQLite database.
It is a very simple example because I want this site to grow with the Playwright's needs.  Most arts people are not technologically advanced, so the easier for them to use the better.

Future enhancements for this site will include slideshows of pictures from the various plays and google analytics for demographic tracking.
